# GraphMining_Amalzen
An academic graph mining project analyzing collaboration patterns among researchers using arXiv data. Includes preprocessing scripts, graph construction, centrality and community detection, and visualizations.

## Resources

- Kaggle dataset

	- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv/data

    The Kaggle dataset link contains the arXiv metadata used in this project:

    a. arXiv metadata OAI snapshot — original metadata dump (large)

- Google Drive — consolidated datasets

	- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CIJmyuIlEqcsBHCT4kxDlWHS6oXzZSrf?usp=sharing

	The Google Drive folder contains the consolidated datasets used in this project, including:

	a. full raw dataset — full, unprocessed arXiv data

	b. sample raw dataset — a small sample of the raw data (included in this repo as `raw_dataset(sample).csv`)

	c. cleaned dataset — preprocessed and cleaned CSV (included in this repo as `cleaned_dataset.csv`)

	d. trimmed dataset — reduced/trimmed CSV for faster experiments (included here as `trimmed_dataset.csv`)

	Note: local copies of the sample, cleaned, and trimmed datasets are included in the repository for convenience. See the repository root for `raw_dataset(sample).csv`, `cleaned_dataset.csv`, and `trimmed_dataset.csv`.
